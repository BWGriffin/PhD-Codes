# PhD-Codes
Codes written for my PhD undertaken at the University of Bristol from 2018 until 2022.
PhD Thesis title: _Quantifying Pterosaur Launch: biomechanical modelling of an ornithocheiraean pterosaur._

Included codes relate to Chapters 3 and 4 and are for use with the R software package. Graphing codes require the Tidyverse ggplot2 library and the patchwork library
Codes are written to be purely functional and are not optimised for distrubution. I am sure most of you could clean these up pretty quickly but they make sense to me.
